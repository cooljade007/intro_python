# OVERVIEW

This project focused on gaining on hand experience with the basics of Python. As part of this project, we used Python to explore the data related to bike share systems from three major cities in the United States: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Our task was to write code that was able to import data and answer questions regarding computing descriptive statistics. We were to write a script that would take the raw input of the users and provide them an interactive experience in the terminal to present these statistics.

Recently, bicycle-sharing systems have grown in popularity. Bicycle-sharing systems allow customers to rent bikes for a short amount of time by simply borrowing a bike from point A and returning the bike to point B.

# ABOUT THE DATASET

We will be using the dataset provide by Motivate, which is one of the popular company that provides a bicycle-sharing system.
 
**FEATURES:**
+ Start Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:07:57)
+ End Time (e.g., 2017-01-01 00:20:53)
+ Trip Duration (in seconds - e.g., 776)
+ Start Station (e.g., Broadway & Barry Ave)
+ End Station (e.g., Sedgwick St & North Ave)
+ User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

The Chicago and New York City files also have the following two columns:
+ Gender
+ Birth Year

## STATISTICS COMPUTED

**1. Popular times of travel (i.e., occurs most often in the start time)**

most common month
most common day of week
most common hour of day

**2. Popular stations and trip**

most common start station
most common end station
most common trip from start to end (i.e., most frequent combination of start station and end station)

**3. Trip duration**

total travel time
average travel time

**4. User info**

counts of each user type
counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
earliest, most recent, most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)
